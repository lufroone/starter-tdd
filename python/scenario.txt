Feature: Moving the Rover on the terrain
  As a Rover controller
  I want to be able to move the Rover on the terrain
  In order to explore the area while avoiding obstacles

  Background:
    Given a 100x100 terrain
    And a Rover positioned at (0,0) facing North
    And 5 obstacles randomly placed on the terrain

  Scenario: Simple forward movement of the Rover
    When I move the Rover forward 10 meters
    Then the Rover's position should be (0,10)
    And no obstacle is hit

  Scenario: Rover rotation
    When I turn the Rover left
    Then the Rover should be facing West
    When I turn the Rover right
    Then the Rover should be facing North

  Scenario: Obstacle detection
    Given an obstacle at position (0,5) with a radius of 1 meter
    When I move the Rover forward 10 meters
    Then an obstacle is detected
    And the command is cancelled
    And the command is recorded in history

  Scenario Outline: Multiple Rover movements
    When I <action> the Rover by <distance> meters
    Then the Rover's position should be <final_position>
    And the command is recorded in history

    Examples:
      | action  | distance | final_position |
      | advance | 5       | (0,5)          |
      | reverse | 3       | (0,-3)         |
